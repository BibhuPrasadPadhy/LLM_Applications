    "            Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip. Build quality was great as always from Apple. Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚Äù Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient as a normal user.\"\"\",\n",
